# Personal Bookshelf

Personal Bookshelf is a React application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and maintain a personal bookshelf in the browser using localStorage.

## Features

- **Book Search**: Users can search for books by typing in the book's name. Search results are displayed in real-time as the user types.
- **Personal Bookshelf**: Users can add books from the search results to their personal bookshelf, which is stored persistently in the browser using localStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: The front-end of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the Open Library API.
- **localStorage**: The Web Storage API is utilized for storing the user's bookshelf data persistently in the browser.
- **Create React App**: The project is initialized using Create React App, which provides a modern build setup with no configuration.
